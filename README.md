This project is an opinionated catalog of open source Golang packages. Libraries come and go. The ecosystem evolves rapidly, and that's a good thing. But it means you can't rely on your bookmarks. Google may not be your best friend either since it focuses on popular results â€” established solutions that may not be the best fit for your project. This project will list down the most popular used Golang libraries.
